## Objectives
Find what determines price.<br />
What is the relationship between Price and Stops?<br />
What is the relationship between Price and Duration?<br />
What is the relationship between Price and Emissions?<br />
What is the relationship between Price and Time?<br />
What other relationships can we see? <br />

## Findings
On average as stops increased, so did Emissions, Duration and Price. However, did drop off towards the end.<br />

Customers perferred 2 stop flights, we saw from total emissions and sum of stops.<br />

Against popular belief the data showed that infact more stops could mean pricier flights.<br />
 
We must stress these are most likely due to longer flights as we witnessed that there were low stops with longer flight times.<br />

However, all these irregularities could be explained by extreme values within the data. <br />
